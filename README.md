## Hi!

#### I am a junior full stack developer, having recently finished a full stack web development course at [@Trybe](https://github.com/betrybe)

My most developed skills lie in React.js, Node.js, vanilla JS/Typescript, and CSS. 
I am also familiar with SQL, express.js, Sequelize, Jest, Mocha, Docker, Redux, MSC architecture, CRUD systems, and a little of SOLID OOP.
